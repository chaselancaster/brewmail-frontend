# BrewMail 
___

BrewMail is a site built for true craft beer enthusiasts. At its core, BrewMail can be used to search for almost any beer in production while allowing users to create a cellar to keep track of what they own at home. 

Users can also offer up beer for trade or add beer that they are in search of. With two build in search functions, BrewMail makes it easy to get quick info on a beer, or find someone who is offering up a brew you want in exchange for something you have in your cellar! 

In the current craft beer market, it is impossible to have every brewery in the country distribute nation wide, so often times really good beer is hard to get. Beer trading is a growing practice and often takes place on Instagram. My hope is to create a platform that makes it easier for people to find the beer that they really want.
